    \item % answer to question 1: Name one way you could improve the experiment and why it would help
    \item % answer to question 2: Name another way you could improve the experiment and why it would help
    \item % answer to question 3: Name a third way you could improve the experiment and why it would help
    \hrule
    \item % answer to question 4: If you had only a small dataset, which model would you prefer, random forest or svc? Why? Refer to your graph in the answer.
    \item % answer to question 5: If you re-run the cell, the plot changes. Why is this? What can you do to prevent that? Is that a good idea?
    \item % answer to question 6: Which seems to be the hardest class (digit) to learn for SVM, and for RandomForest? How can you tell?
    
    \hrule
    \item % answer to question 7: Why do you think that class is harder?

    \item % answer to question 8: Which point is preferable, 14 or 15? Why?
    \item % answer to question 9: Which point is preferable, 15 or 16? Why?
    \item % answer to question 10: Give an example of a ML task where you would prefer the random forest over the logistic model. Refer to your graph in the answer.
    \item % answer to question 11: Give an example of a ML task where you would prefer the logistic model over the random forest. Refer to your graph in the answer.
    \item % answer to question 12: What does it mean that point 47 of the random forest is below the (0,0) to (1,1) diagonal?
